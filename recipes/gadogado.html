<p>
    Gado gado is a popular Indonesian dish that consists of a mixed vegetable salad served with a peanut sauce dressing. 
    It is a traditional dish that is commonly found in Indonesian cuisine, particularly in Javanese and Sundanese cuisine.
    The term "gado gado" translates to "mix-mix" or "medley" in Indonesian, reflecting the diverse array of ingredients used in the dish. 
    While the exact ingredients may vary depending on regional and personal preferences, typical components of gado gado include boiled or steamed vegetables such as spinach, bean sprouts, cabbage, potatoes, and green beans, along with tofu, tempeh (fermented soybean cake), and hard-boiled eggs. 
    Sometimes, additional ingredients like sliced cucumber, tomatoes, and lontong (compressed rice cakes) are also included.</p>
