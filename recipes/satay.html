<h1>Pork Satay</h1>
<img src="../images/satay.jpg">
    <p>Indonesian pork satay, also known as "sate babi" in Indonesian, is a popular dish in Indonesia consisting of skewered and grilled pork meat.
     It's a variation of the more common chicken or beef satay. We'd like to make our version of satay using rica-rica seasoning.
     Rica-rica is an Indonesian sambal laced with chilli, ginger and lime, and works equally well with prawns, chicken or fish fillets for a fiery BBQ treat.
